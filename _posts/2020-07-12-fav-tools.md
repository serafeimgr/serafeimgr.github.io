   Now you could avoid this situation and execute the following.


   `$ tldr tar`
    
    tar

    Archiving utility.
    Often combined with a compression method, such as gzip or bzip.
    More information: https://www.gnu.org/software/tar.

    - Create an archive from files:
      tar cf target.tar file1 file2 file3

    - Create a gzipped archive:
      tar czf target.tar.gz file1 file2 file3

    - Create a gzipped archive from a directory using relative paths:
      tar czf target.tar.gz -C path/to/directory .

    - Extract a (compressed) archive into the current directory:
      tar xf source.tar[.gz|.bz2|.xz]

    - Extract an archive into a target directory:
      tar xf source.tar -C directory

    - Create a compressed archive, using archive suffix to determine the compression program:
      tar caf target.tar.xz file1 file2 file3

    - List the contents of a tar file:
      tar tvf source.tar

    - Extract files matching a pattern:
      tar xf source.tar --wildcards "*.html"
