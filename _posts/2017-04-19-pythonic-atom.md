Assuming you know and use [Atom](http://atom.io) (and if you don't, you should),  i will briefly describe a package i published not long ago.
 As you may imagine by it's name i tried to gather some pythonic features from other packages into this one for easier set up.

[Pythonic Atom](https://atom.io/packages/pythonic-atom) installs the folowing packages:

     linter
     linter-ui-default
     linter-pycodestyle
     minimap
     minimap-linter
     MagicPython
     python-tools
     python-yapf
     autocomplete-python
     hyperclick
     script
     python-isort

Includes settings & python packages best-suited for python development, make sure you have pip installed and your path configured properly.

Have fun coding :)
