---

I am going to share with you some of the tools that i use everyday.                 
Tools that make my work easier and hopefully it will make yours too.           
These are not actual development tools but help to do the job faster.          

 - [1Clipboard](http://1clipboard.io)
   
   1Clipboard keeps track of all the things that you have copied around.               
   You can set your favorites and you can also sync your clipboard with
   multiple computers using your Google account.
 - [cmder](https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder) (Windows only)            
   
   
   Ever tried Git on Windows? yeah..             
   Thankfully cmder is the best alternative out there for anyone that seeks a decent terminal in the Microsoft
   world.           
   Supports bash out of the box too!
   
   [hyperjs](https://hyper.is/) is another option that deserves a
   mention.               
   Built on Electron, in the past releases it
   supports all major platforms.

 - [Launchy](https://www.launchy.net/) (Windows only)      
   
   If you always wanted to get a Mac but for whatever reason you could
   not, well there is Launcy that brings the Spotlight feature into your
   Windows PC.

 
 - [Lightshot](https://app.prntscr.com/en/index.html)
   
   Because there are things you cannot explain without a screenshot.    
   Lightshot does the job simply and offers a cloud upload option.
 - [Vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb)
   
   Used to vim keybindings?              
   This Chrome extension got you
   covered.               
   Just install it and you are ready to go.
   
 - [MobaXterm](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) (Windows only)                 
 Hands down the best SSH client for Windows.
